## Project Purpose

This project was created to deepen my knowledge about front-end development by applying concept such as hooks, data fetching, page routing, and conditional rendering. I also exposed myself to the current front-end technology by using popular frameworks such as React.JS, Next.JS, and Material UI.

## Technology Used

* React.JS
* Next.JS
* Material UI
* react-chartjs-2

## Getting Started

To run this application, first clone this github project into your machine by running the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rifqiadityaa/admin-web.git
```

After that, go inside the cloned folder and install all the dependencies by running the command:
```bash
npm install
```

After all the dependencies are downloaded, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Finally you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
